## About the application

Storefront is a customizable online platform designed primarily for businesses to showcase and sell their products to customers. Whether a retailer selling handmade jewelry or a large-scale enterprise, Storefront offers a user-friendly interface where customers can easily browse and make purchases. While the platform is tailored for customer interactions and sales, it does not handle inventory management. Instead, the backend business operations, including inventory management and order processing, are seamlessly integrated with Cueprise. This combination ensures that while customers enjoy a streamlined shopping experience on Storefront, business owners can efficiently manage their operations using Cueprise. The platform is flexible, catering to businesses of all sizes, and can be tailored to match a brand's unique look and functionality.
